# surfs_up

## Overview

This analysis is based on trying to open up a business called Surf n' Shake shop. This business would serve surf boards and ice cream to locals and tuorist. To make it happen, investors are needed. The investor is worried about the weather before investing. In this analysis I have completed an analytics on weather in Hawaii. To do this, I have used tools such as Python, Jupyter Notebook, SQLight database, and a module SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy is a great tool in Python to query data in SQLite databases. 

In order to filter the data down to specific months of the year, I utilized the extract method in SQLAlchemy.
