# surfs_up

## Overview

This analysis is based on trying to open up a business called Surf n' Shake shop. This business would serve surf boards and ice cream to locals and tourists. To make it happen, investors are needed. The investor is worried about the weather before investing. In this analysis I have completed analytics on weather in Hawaii. To do this, I have used tools such as Python, Jupyter Notebook, SQLight database, and a module SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy is a great tool in Python to query data in SQLite databases.

In order to filter the data down to specific months of the year, I utilized the extract method in SQLAlchemy. 

#### Filtering Code Sample

## Results

- June is a great time of the year for surfing and ice cream with a mean temperature of 75 degrees. 75% of days have a high temperature of 73 or higher.

#### June Temp Stats

- December is also a great time of year for the surfing and ice cream shop with a mean temperature of 71 degrees. 75% of days have a high temperature above 69 degrees. 
 
#### December Temp Stats

- With December and June temperatures suitable for ice cream and surfing, it is safe to say the other months of year also have a suitable temperature for the shop to remain open all year.

## Summary

In summary Surf n' Shake shop has a high chance of being successful in Hawaii based on temp alone. Temperatures are high enough year-round for both areas of the business to remain successful. Additional queries I would run would be on precipitation and existing shops with similar products around the island.
